                                          Overview
The Emotionally Aware Productivity Assistant is a LangGraph-based AI that blends practical productivity features with empathetic, human-like conversation.
It can:
Detect and respond to your emotional state
Schedule and reschedule events
Set reminders
Summarize conversations
Answer questions & give advice
Handle overwhelm by offering task prioritization or just talking
The assistant adapts its tone and responses dynamically to your mood, making it both a helpful productivity partner and a supportive conversational companion.

                                         Features
Emotion Detection â†’ Routes conversations based on your mood (overwhelm, venting, productive, etc.)
Reminder Management â†’ Extracts what to remind you about and when
Scheduling â†’ Books events via schedule_node
Rescheduling â†’ Adjusts event timings via reschedule_node
Multi-Turn Context â†’ Maintains conversation history (history) for better responses
Tone Adaptation â†’ Uses respond_with_empathy_node to fine-tune messages
Overwhelm Handling â†’ Gives you options: reschedule, prioritize, or talk
Final Response Node â†’ Wraps up interactions in a natural way

                                  Architecture
The assistant is built using:
LangGraph â†’ for defining nodes and routing logic
LLM-powered tools â†’ for extracting event/reminder info and generating empathetic responses
TypedDict state â†’ to store and update user info across nodes

                            Workflow Example
User Input: "I'm feeling overwhelmed, I have too much to do."
respond_with_empathy_node detects emotion â†’ routes to overwhelm_node
post_overwhelm_router_node asks: reschedule tasks, prioritize, or just talk
If "reschedule" â†’ goes to reschedule_node and updates the event list
Ends at final_response_node with a supportive wrap-up

                     Current Limitations
This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Some features are not yet implemented:
Authentication for Scheduling & Rescheduling
Right now, schedule_node and reschedule_node assume open access.
Future: OAuth integration with Google Calendar.

Multi-Intent Routing
Currently routes one action per turn.
Future: Split messages like
"Remind me to call mum and also schedule a meeting."
into multiple actions.

Plugin Expansion
Will add more tools (e.g.knowledge retrieval, document Q&A).

                         Future Roadmap
âœ… Emotion-first routing system
âœ… Memory for last 4â€“5 messages
ðŸ”„ OAuth calendar integration
ðŸ”„ Multi-intent handling
ðŸ”„ Plugin store integration
ðŸ”„ Better context compression for long conversations

                   How to Run
